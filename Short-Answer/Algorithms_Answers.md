#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This algorithm runs in O(n) time; as the size of n increases,
the number of times the loop executes increases linearly.


b)This algorithm runs in O(n**2) time; the while loop nested inside the for loop
will cause the time to increase roughly exponentially.


c)This algorithm runs in O(n) time; it is running a fixed number of times,
where if bunnies (n) = 1 it would execute in O(1) time. the recursive call will execute n-1 total times,
meaning the time to completion grows linearly with the increase of n as 1 + n-1.

## Exercise II

Binary search

Drop an egg off of floor n // 2 (n1);

if it breaks, f is below n1. If it doesn't break, f is above n1.
continue dropping eggs from the midpoint of nk and the current floor or ceiling (nprev)
until f is reached; this will lead to ~ k/2 eggs broken, with f found in k steps.
runtime complexity is O(log n))
